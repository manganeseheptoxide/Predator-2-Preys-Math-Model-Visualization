# Predator-2-Preys-Math-Model-Visualization
I created a Python code to interactively visualize and simulate a mathematical model modeling the interaction between Foxes, Hares, and Cottontails for my math modeling class. The mathematical model was from a paper titled [A Mathematical Model Supporting a Hyperpredation Effect in the Apparent Competition Between Invasive Eastern Cottontail and Native European Hare](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350440827_A_Mathematical_Model_Supporting_a_Hyperpredation_Effect_in_the_Apparent_Competition_Between_Invasive_Eastern_Cottontail_and_Native_European_Hare)
